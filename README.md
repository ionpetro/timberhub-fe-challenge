## Data fetching

To serve data to the front end, I used the `Next.js` api routes that is implemented inside the framework. See `src/pages/api/projects.ts`.

In order to fetch data to the client, `axios` library was used.

## Technologies

### Tools

I used `React` with `NextJS`. 

Other development tools that were used are:

- **Eslint**: For coding standards
- **Prettier**: For code formatting
- **Husky**: For code linting before commits
- **Typescript**: for type checking and autocomplete.

### Styling

For styling, I chose `antd` component library followed by `less` preprocessor in order to demonstrate the use and set up of the library. `CSS modules` are also supported.

### Testing

I used `jest` and `@testing-library` to unit test a service and a component (demo purposes).

### Folder structure

Inside `/src` folder you can find a `/components` folder that hosts all the components of the app.
Inside that, each folder represent the wrapper of a next page, and that includes the components only relevant to that page.
Usually, you also have a `/shared` folder with the components used throughout the whole application. 

```
/components
|  <page>
|  |  <components_relevant_to_page>
/pages
```
